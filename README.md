# Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science

Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science is a beginner-friendly specialization where you’ll master the fundamental mathematics toolkit of machine learning: calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability.

Many machine learning engineers and data scientists struggle with mathematics. Challenging interview questions often hold people back from leveling up in their careers, and even experienced practitioners can feel held by a lack of math skills.

This Specialization uses innovative pedagogy in mathematics to help you learn quickly and intuitively, with courses that use easy-to-follow plugins and visualizations to help you see how the math behind machine learning actually works. Upon completion, you’ll understand the mathematics behind all the most common algorithms and data analysis techniques — plus the know-how to incorporate them into your machine learning career.

The skill you get from this course is:
- A deep understanding of what makes algorithms work, and how to tune them for custom implementation.
- Statistical techniques that empower you to get more out of your data analysis.
- Skills that employers desire, helping you ace machine learning interview questions and land your dream job.
