# Singular and Non-singular Matrix
A matrix is singular if the determinant of the matrix is zero, and non-singular if the determinant is non-zero.
```math
$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
5 & 1 \\
-1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}$$
```
The determinant is $(5)(3) - (-1)(1) = 15 - -1 = 16$. (Non-singular)
For a matrix 
```math
$$B = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 \\
-6 & 3
\end{bmatrix}$$
```
The determinant is $(2)(3) - (-1)(-6) = 6 - 6 = 0$. (Singular)

A system of rows of square matrix are *linearly independent* if and only if the determinant of the matrix is not equal to zero. If the determinant of the matrix equals zero, then the rows of square matrix are *linearly dependent*.
